    "<hr id='subTitle'>",
    "<p>Blockchain offers privacy, transparency, and immutability. You will be powered to use applications, transact anywhere, and do a lot more without anyone watching (read Google, Governments).</p>",
    "<p>But there are various blockchains, each one coded for a different purpose.</p>",
    "<p>However, Ethereum, a gigantic decentralized ecosystem, is for the masses. And MetaMask is a free, open-source, hot wallet to get you rolling with Ethereum.</p>",
    "<p>Let’s take a look at some of the prominent features of this wallet:</p>",
    "<h4>Ease of use</h4>",
    "<p>Starting with MetaMask is easy, quick, and anonymous. You don’t even need an email address. Just set up a password and remember (and store) the secret recovery phrase, and you’re done.</p>",
    "<h4>Security</h4>",
    "<p>Your information is encrypted in your browser that nobody has access to. In the event of a lost password, you have the 12-word secret recovery phase (also called a seed phrase) for recovery. Notably, it’s essential to keep the seed phrase safe, as even MetaMask has no information about it. Once lost, it can’t be retrieved.</p>",
    "<h4>Built-In Crypto Store</h4>",
    "<p>If you’re wondering, no, you can’t buy Bitcoin with MetaMask. It only supports Ether and other Ether-related tokens, including the famous ERC-20 tokens. Cryptocurrencies (excluding Ether) on Ethereum are built as ERC-20 tokens.</p>",
    "<h4>Backup and Restore</h4>",
    "<p>MetaMask stores your information locally. So, in case you switch browsers or machines, you can restore your MetaMask wallet with your secret recovery phrase.</p>",
    "<h4>Community Support</h4>",
    "<p>As of August 2021, MetaMask was home to 10 million monthly active users around the world. Its simple and intuitive user interface keeps pushing these numbers with a recorded 1800% increase from July 2020.</p>",
    "<p>Conclusively, try MetaMask if hot wallets are your pick. Let’s begin with the installation before moving to its use cases. Further sections entail the illustration for Chrome web browser and Android mobile platform.</p>"

    "<h2>Installing MetaMask on Chrome</h2>",
    "<hr id='subTitle'>",
    "<p>Go to the <a href='https://metamask.io/'>download page</a>, choose your platform, and hit the download button at the button. It will auto-detect the browser. But for iOS and Android, select your platform to get the links or search in the respective app stores.</p>",
    "<h4>MetaMask Browser Extension</h4>",
    "<p>I’ll demonstrate this with the chrome browser. Visit the download page and Click Install MetaMask for Chrome to visit the MetaMask extension page on the chrome web store.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me1.jpeg' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Install and pin that to make it available in your browser toolbar. This process is similar to installing any browser extension on chrome.</p>",
    "<h4>MetaMask Wallet Registration</h4>",
    "<p>Finally, you will be greeted with this. Now click Get Started to begin the registration process.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me2.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>The subsequent screen will give you the option to Import Wallet, or you can Create a Wallet. Click the latter option to register a new one.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me3.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Next, you can choose to share some anonymous data with MetaMask to jump on to the following screen. You can click No Thanks for complete peace of mind–it won’t hamper your user experience with MetaMask. Select accordingly and proceed.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me4.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Now Create a strong password on the following screen.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me5.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Now it’s time to save the secret recovery phrase. You can uncover the secret phrase and download it as a text file. Then click Next to proceed.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me6.jpeg' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>MetaMask goes to lengths to ensure you remember this important phrase as they don’t store it for you. So you see a word puzzle to rebuild that phrase, exactly the way it was. Unless you get it right, the Confirm button at the end won’t get activated, and you can’t proceed.</p>",
    "<p>And if you’ve missed remembering or saving it, there is a back button under the MetaMask icon at the top. That will take you to the previous page to download and memorize it.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me7.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Once you complete this, the Confirm button will come to life. Click that, and you will see the congratulations message on the last screen of the registration process.</p>",
    "<img id='imgArticle' src='./imgs/me8.webp' alt='Metamask'>",
    "<p>Finally, click the All Done on the congratulations page to enter into your wallet dashboard.</p>",
